# Family Identity & Beneficiary Management Platform

A government digital platform that gives each verified family a stable, non-sensitive
**Family ID**, maintains verified family relationships, and connects eligible members to
government welfare schemes.

Hackathon MVP. Built as a **modular monolith**: React frontend, Express REST API,
PostgreSQL via Prisma.

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios, React Flow |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript |
| Database | PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM |
| Auth | JWT + bcrypt, role-based access control |
| Validation | Zod |
| Uploads | Multer (local disk in dev, S3-compatible in deployment) |
| Tests | Jest + Supertest |

JavaScript only — no TypeScript.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Docker (for the local PostgreSQL container)

### Database

PostgreSQL runs in Docker on port **5433**, so it does not collide with any
PostgreSQL already installed on the host.

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # set POSTGRES_PASSWORD
docker compose up -d
```

This creates both `family_identity` and `family_identity_test`.

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET
npm run dev
```

Apply migrations:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

The API listens on `http://localhost:5000`.

Health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "Family Identity Platform API is running" }
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173` and proxies `/api` to the backend,
so there is no CORS setup in development.

### Tests

```bash
cd backend  && npm test   # jest + supertest
cd frontend && npm test   # vitest + react testing library
```

## API response format

Every endpoint returns a consistent envelope.

Success:

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "...", "data": {} }
```

Error:

```json
{ "success": false, "message": "...", "errors": [] }
```

## Roles

`CITIZEN`, `VERIFICATION_OFFICER`, `DISTRICT_OFFICER`, `ADMIN`.

Authorization is always enforced on the backend; frontend role checks are presentation only.

Citizens self-register. Government accounts cannot be created through the public API
by design, so seed them:

```bash
cd backend
npm run db:seed
```

| Account | Email | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verification Officer | officer@example.gov | VERIFICATION_OFFICER |
| District Officer | district@example.gov | DISTRICT_OFFICER |
| Administrator | admin@example.gov | ADMIN |

All seeded accounts use the password `Password123`. Development only — the seed
script refuses to run when NODE_ENV is production.

## API endpoints

## Privacy

This is a prototype. Only synthetic/dummy identity data is used. Family IDs never
contain Aadhaar or any other sensitive identity number.
